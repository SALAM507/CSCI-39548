    Throughout its history, Banff National Park has been shaped by tension between conservationist 
and land exploitation interests. The park was established on November 25, 1885, as Banff Hot 
Springs Reserve, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and 
who had the right to develop the hot springs for commercial interests. The conservationists 
prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected 
reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the 
Columbia Icefield.

    Under the Köppen climate classification, the park has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with 
cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. The climate is influenced by altitude with lower 
temperatures generally found at higher elevations. Located on the eastern side of the 
Continental Divide, Banff National Park receives 472 millimeters (18.6 in) of precipitation 
annually. This is considerably less than in Yoho National Park on the western side of 
the divide in British Columbia, where 884 mm (34.8 in) is received at Wapta Lake and 
616 mm (24.3 in) at Boulder Creek annually. Being influenced by altitude, snowfall is 
also greater at higher elevations. As such, 234 cm (92 in) of snow falls on average each 
year in the Banff townsite, while 304 cm (120 in) falls in Lake Louise, which is located 
at a higher altitude.
        
    During winter months, temperatures in Banff are moderate, compared to other areas of 
central and northern Alberta, due to Chinook winds and other influences from British Columbia. 
The mean low temperature during January is −15 °C (5 °F), and the mean high temperature is −5 °C (23 °F) 
for the town of Banff.However, temperatures can drop below −20 °C (−4.0 °F) with wind chill values 
dropping below −30 °C (−22.0 °F).Weather conditions during summer months are warm, with high temperatures 
during July averaging 22 °C (72 °F), and daily low temperatures averaging 7 °C (45 °F), leading to a large 
diurnal range owing to the relative dryness of the air.

        <h2><u>Ecology</u></h2>
        <dl>
            <dt style="font-size:125%">Ecoregions</dt>
                <dd><pre>
    Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. 
The subalpine ecoregion, which consists mainly of dense forest, comprises 53 percent 
of Banff's area. 27 percent of the park is located above the tree line, in the alpine 
ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at 2,300 m (7,500 ft), with open 
meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3 percent) 
of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine 
forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, 
occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are more 
common in the subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. 
The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, 
have been subjected to significant human development over the years.

    The park has 56 recorded mammal species. Grizzly bears and black bears inhabit the forested regions. 
Cougar, lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and timber wolf are the primary 
predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, 
including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose tend to be more elusive, 
sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goats, 
bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, 
chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. 
Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the 
last five remaining within park boundaries. The American bison was extirpated in Banff, but was 
brought back to the park in 2017, and one free-roaming herd lives within the protected area.

    Due to the harsh winters, the park has few reptile and amphibian species with only one species 
of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been 
identified. At least 280 species of birds can be found in Banff including bald and golden eagles, 
red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen 
species such as the Canada jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, 
mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan 
is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a 
hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.

    Endangered species in Banff include the Banff Springs snail (Physella Johnsoni) that is found in the 
hot springs of Banff,and the Woodland caribou.

        <h2><u>Human Impact</u></h2>
        <pre>
Since the 19th century, humans have impacted Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, 
controls on other species, and development in the Bow Valley, among other human activities. Bison once lived 
in the valleys of Banff and were hunted by indigenous people, but the last bison were killed off in 1850s. 
In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains Bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk 
are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. 
The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in 
the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley 
include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing 
areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway 
between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.
